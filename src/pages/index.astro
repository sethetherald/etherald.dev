      <h2>Hello and welcome!</h2>
      <p>
        I'm TÃ¹ng <small>(you can call me Seth if you can't pronouce that btw)</small>.
      </p>

      </p>
        I'm specialized in Back-end developing, though I don't have any real-world experience yet.
        I have a tiny bit of experience with front-end stuff, not much to have any valuable opinion on it though.

        <i>(As to why I'm not a full stack developer, I'll probably explain that in a future blog post. Soon<sup>TM</sup>)</i>

      <h2>Why does this website look so basic?</h2>
      <p>
        I shamelessly stole the design from <a href="https://hxann.com/">an old version of my friend's website</a>.
      </p>

      <h2>Why doesn't this website have Light Theme?</h2>
      <p>What are you, a psychopath?</p>
